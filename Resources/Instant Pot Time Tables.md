## Dried Legumes

- Dried beans double in size, so don't fill the pot more than half full.
- Use enough liquid to cover the beans.
- Beans are easy to undercook and hard to overcook, so turn off heat and let natural release after cooking.

| Dried Legumes         | Dried, Minutes    | Soaked, Minutes   |
|:----------------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| Beans (most varieties)| 25-30             | 15                |

| Lentils               | 18                | n/a               |

## Meat

- Don't try to thicken sauces before cooking or it may burn, thicken after cooking.
- Browning the meat before cooking increases the flavor.
